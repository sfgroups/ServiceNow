1. Modify the UI Action Record
Go to the UI Action record for your custom action and navigate to the Workspace section:
Workspace Form Button: Ensure this is Checked.
Workspace Form Menu: Ensure this is Unchecked. If this is checked, the system often defaults it to the overflow menu.
Format for Configurable Workspace: Ensure this is Checked to ensure it is properly registered for modern workspace experiences.
